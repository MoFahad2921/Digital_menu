# digital_menu
This is a java swing based program that acts as a self-payment digital menu.

This code is a simple Java Swing application that calculates the total cost of lunch sets and side orders. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

The demo class is defined with a main method that takes no arguments.

Several integer variables are declared to store the quantity of adult and kids lunch sets, the total cost of adult and kids lunch sets, and the overall total cost.

A String variable input is declared to store the user input when prompted for the quantity of lunch sets.

Two message dialogs are displayed to inform the user of the cost of adult and kids lunch sets respectively.

Two input dialogs prompt the user to enter the quantity of adult and kids lunch sets, respectively. The user input is stored as integers using the parseInt method.

The cost of the lunch sets is calculated by multiplying the quantity by the respective cost per set.

The total cost is calculated by adding the cost of adult and kids lunch sets together.

Two integer variables newtotal1 and newtotal2 are declared to store the cost of the lunch sets and the selected side order.

A message dialog is displayed to show the total cost of the lunch sets.

A confirmation dialog prompts the user to select whether or not they want to buy a side order.

If the user selects "No" in the confirmation dialog, a message dialog is displayed to show the total cost of the lunch sets and a thank you message.

If the user selects "Yes" in the confirmation dialog, a message dialog is displayed to show the cost of the salad and dessert side orders.

An array of buttons is declared to allow the user to select a side order.

A message dialog is displayed to prompt the user to select a side order from the array of buttons.

If the user selects "Salad", the new total cost is calculated by adding $4 to the previous total cost.

If the user selects "Dessert", the new total cost is calculated by adding $5 to the previous total cost.

A message dialog is displayed to show the new total cost and a thank you message.
